# Alien vs. Predator: Legends

## Introduction
AVP: Legends was a MUD I created back around 2003, I think I was around 16-17 at the time, so don't hold the code quality against me, haha. It descends from SWR, a descendant of SMAUG. 

## Disclaimer
This code is provided as-is. I haven't touched it in two decades now, and remember very little about how to setup or operate the MUD. I also made only a quick pass to scrub personal email addresses and old accounts, so I don't know what else you'll find in these files. 

## Running the Server
- Compile the Packages
    - `apt-get install make`
    - `apt-get install g++`
    - `apt-get install libz-dev`
- Start the server
    - Move into the `src` directory.
    - Run `./avpscript` to launch the server on port 7000.

Because it descends from SWR, I would suggest trying those instructions if you hit a wall.
