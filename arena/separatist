Name         Separatist Camp~
Desc         Take and hold the six Separatist command positions.

Marine:
We have located a small seperatist instillation on one of our colonies.
Luckily, The seperatists do not have support of the citizens - This means
we can remove them with extreme prejudice. Take control of the command
structure. We are not certain how big this seperatist faction is, so expect
a counterstrike. Eliminate all resistance. 
 
Alien:
Consume! Grow! Spread!
 
Predator:
We have released several alien eggs near a military installation, and they
should make worthy prey. Watch out for the humans, they will try to
disrupt the hunt.
