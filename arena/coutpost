Name         Communications Outpost~
Desc         A USCM Communications Outpost located in the middle of a Jungle. Generally
considered to be one of the most boring places in the universe to be
stationed, it has suddenly fallen under attack. 
 
USCM Marines must move in and secure the base. They must maintain the power
by using the Backup Generator as needed, and keep the Landing Beacon
online for the Support Dropships to land. 
 
Aliens and Predators must lay siege to the outpost, working their way up
from the bottom floor to the roof, to disable the landing beacon and
prevent the marines from getting support. They can also destroy the
Primary Generator to knock out power to the facility.
