&WNear the remains of a crashed Cheyenne&w~
&cThe &CUSCM&c Starship Cheyenne lays in several pieces, here. Its hull
appears to be completely destroyed, resulting in a painful death for the
pilots. The Cheyenne seems to have smashed a large section of the &GLV-426
C&golony's&c protective fencing upon impact. This appears to have opened a
fairly accessible entrance to the Colony's main base.

&WA small Clearing&w~
&cA large escape shuttle has landed here, and although damaged slightly on
impact the passenger section of it seems to have served its purpose well.
There are several small tracks which appear to have been made by the soles
of a human boot, aswell as crates which appear to contain ammo and other
military weaponry.

&WA large opening in the Fence&D~
&cA large section of the fence has been smashed by the crashing of the
&CUSCM&c spaceship Cheyenne. The fence normally was meant to keep any
unknown intruders out, as a slight defense against a horror that an
officer of the company reported, however unrealistic it was.

&WAn open Clearing~
&cSoutheast of the Cheyenne crashsite there are still obvious parts of the
ship. A large fragment of the wing is smashed deep into the ground, while
nearby a section of the passenger seating is visible. This section of the
seating almost appears to be a skeleton of its former self.

&WA path to the south of the Cheyenne&D~
&cA path seems to be visible a little to the south of the Cheyenne. This
path goes further south, into what then appears a turn. A Large section of
the Cheyenne cargo bay, can be seen along the eastern side of the path,
and it is quite obvious that anything remaining side, will stay there, for
a long, long, time.

The Entrance to a Control Tower~
&cThis large tower is one of the primary defensive points of the colony, as
it allows the Marine guards to watch for movement and fire upon them with
very little chance of a counter attack. Although the entrance is open to
the east and north, a trapdoor is the only entrance to the upper level. 
~
&gThe tower appears to be a disgusting mirror of its former self, as now
large bulbous fleshlike materials hang from the upper floor and along the
outside walls. A small pool of &RB&rlood&g has formed near the ladder that
leads to the trapdoor above.

The Control Tower~
&cThis large tower has been built with only defense in mind. The windows
face the only two possible directions of approach and can only be fired
from if the shooter is located inside the tower. Two large computer
screens line the western wall, showing  a grid arround this tower so that
any movement can be tracked.
~
&gLarge bulbous materials coat the inside of this room, ruining several of
the normal defensive functions of the tower itself. A young marines body
lies near the trapdoor, his throat ripped open.  Surely whatever has
caused this cannot be far.

To the east of the Cheyenne Crashsite~
&cA large section of the piloting control-board is smashed against the
ground here, making it obvious that the removal of the Cheyenne's damage,
is going to take a lot of time. Still quite visible is the wreckage of the
starship itself, where it smashed into the fencing of the Colony.

a Odd Clearing~
&cThis clearing has been desecrated from the affects of gunfire, energy
weaponry, and explosives. To the north is probably the reason of half the
desecration, the remains of a Marine Guardtower. While to the east, it
appears the creatures that destroyed the guardtower may have escaped
through a hole melted into the fence itself.

assume is the affect of an energy weapon. The edges of the fence itself
curve inward and end in strange stubs that normally are the result of an
extreme heat.

energy weapons, and explosives. Whomever attacked the tower, was very

&WThe Entrance to the Command Center~
&gThe outside of the command center is a ghastly sight, as it is obvious
that aliens are upon this planet. The Entire door, has been torn
completely off its henges, and the slashes in it are incredibly deep.
Within the door itself is what appears to be Demolished Scientific
equipment, which was most likely meant to 'study' the inhabitants of the
planet.

&WA large Armored Garage Entrance&D~
Outside a large garage, which can only be used to hold the militarys
vehicles and mechanical assistance units. It more then likely has a guard
stationed at it at all times, but then again, perhaps they do not expect
any trouble, as life has been quiet for this colony, for such a long time.

A large Garage~
This garage holds what used to be state of the art mechanical assistance,
and military vehicles. Used to be, that is...20 years ago. Now these
vehicles have become rusty, and if they still work, it would be a miracle.
~
&gA hole has been rended through the eastern wall, destroying the security
camera that watched these vehicles just in case something of this type may
happen. It is most likely that any poor sap who thought to defend this
place,  is now dead, because it has been completely hived, by those of the
Alien Kind.

the Back of the Garage~
The back room of the Garage holds a small resting place for the old guard
posted here, a cot in the corner, a bookshelf containing all playboy
magazines, going back the last 30 years, and a coffee machine on his desk.
A large sword scabbard seems to hang from over the cot, oddly now
empty.
~
&gThe back room of the garage, consists of a destroyed Cot, which now holds
a man cocooned securely, A Magazine rack of playboys, going back 30 years,
covered in an acidic slime, which melted through every single photo, but
left all the articles alone, and, A coffee machine which has been
destroyed, in the most hideous of ways...The pot was broken.

suffocate the men defending the colony.

hang from the ceiling. Every so often, a blob of acidic slime will drop

A small Guard-station~
A Small guard station which allows the user to fire in several directions,
and reload in what was assumed as very great defense. Boasting very few
weaknesses. A Display pannel normally would allow the user to see anything
coming, but sadly, its smashed.
~
&gOnce this used to be a well built guard tower, but somehow an alien made
its way in and demolished everything of worth, and coated it in what can
only be called...slime.

The USCM Cooling System~
This chamber is what cools the entire colony down, as its vents reach
through each and every building that was deemed as important. It has been
taken care of quite well, most likely as the marines did not want to die
of boredom, nor melt to death. 
~
&gThe vents themselves remain in working order, but the cooling system has
been destroyed with use of a long, serrated object. The damage was not
only to the cooling system thou, as there are also long slashes in the
walls themselves, and acid has eaten holes through several sections of the
floor.

"Kcuf Uoy Dlein" Cantonese Bar~
A large bar table goes along the room, with several old fashioned bar
stools facing the door. On the opposite side of the entrance, a large
grill is placed, which is often used to make the best Cantonese food on
LV-426. Although, being the only location they can get Cantonese food,
does make that a bit easier.
~
&gOnce a well established bar, the Kcuf Uoy Dlein is now a hideous
reflection of its former self. Odd, fleshlike glands cover the walls,
oozing slime, and acid.. A Body is on the grill, sizzling, and judging by
the name on the bodies jacket, This  would be Dlein.

the Sleeping quarters of the USCM Marines is Oddly unguarded, perhaps the
marines figured with so many of them there, they would be perfectly safe
at all times. The building also contains the Cooling system, which vents
the entire Colony.
~
&gThe housing quarters are now covered in a acidic slime, which drips from
the ceiling with a disgusting plop, and sizzle. The poor marines likely
still sleeping will not know what hit them, And the vents are now free for
travel for the Alien Kind.

The bunkrooms of the USCM Marines~
A small bedroom for the marines to use, after the days work has been
finished. It is somewhat obvious, from the disgusting housekeeping, and
the fact that they leave the toilet seat up, that the marines are all,
Male. The Women have their own quarters, which they happily use. 
~
Although the housekeeping was bad before, it seems it was possible to get
even worse. Now, everything is coated in slime, the toilet lid is STILL
up, cocoons hang over the bunks, and, the aliens have taken to using the
bunks as a form of..Outhouse.

A Hallway~
&gThis hallway is covered in large bulbous glands, which cover the walls,
and hang from the ceiling. Every so often, a blob of acidic slime will
drop from above, with a hiss. Sounds are heard further down the hallway,
as if something quickly moved by it.

A Working Station~
&gThis small chamber is where the scholars would send in information for
the USCM to study and log, but now, all that is left, is the blood of
those who 'used' to work here, and the slime left by their killers.

The Nesting Chamber~
&gLarge Pods line the walls of this chamber, each containing what once was

Power Supply Generator~
&gA generator sits amongst a large pile of slime, in fact, its covered in
it. The Back is slightly damaged it appears, but it may still work. Then
again, it may just explode. Along the walls surrounding the generator, are
bits of dry blood and and even more slime..Along the floor, mutilated
bodies are numerous, this place appears to not be the safest place to be.

The Hangar Bay~
This Chamber has been developed to contain the spacecraft the colonists
themselves landed within, and has held it for the last fourteen years. If
you are in this chamber, it more then likely means there is an emergency,
and that the ship  will be used, once more.
