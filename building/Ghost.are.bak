&zDeck of the Desolation &w:: &WSteel Bridge~
A massive steel gangway runs the length of the Desolation, allowing access
across the deck without having to go around the edges. It also provides
access to the Helicopter pad at the center of the deck. The gangway is
roughly two men wide, barely enough room to manuever in a firefight. You

The Boarding Ramp of the Marine Dropship is a wide open room, with nothing
to hide behind. It would be incredibly easy to get picked off here, so
tread lightly. Somewhere around here is likely a cargo compartment, where
an alien could stowaway if they were so inclinded.

The Engineering Bay is cluttered with tools from last minute repairs and
preperations. A large portion has been converted to bunks for the last

from the ramp to the cargo bay, for moving large equipment and containers
into and out of the ship. To the north is the Dropship Cockpit.

The waves slam against the side of the Desolation, breaking against the
massive walls. The freezing water and violent wash insures death for even
the most powerful creatures. Trying to swim would merely serve to tire you
out before smashing you on the ship or towing you under a wave.

The corridors of the Desolation are poorly lit and maintained. Pipes and
electrical conduits line the walls and ceiling, running the length of the
passage. The pipes creak and shudder as the ship shifts in the rough
ocean. Colored lines painted on the floor run up and down the corridor,
indicating the location of important rooms on the ship.

&gThe corridors of the Desolation are covered in a dark resin, secreted by
the Alien hellspawns. The pipes and electrical conduits have been torn
apart, exposing wires and massive holes in the walls. Cubbies and tunnels
branch off from the corridor, creating a myriad of places to hide. The air
is warm and dry, and the  sounds of combat can be heard in the distance.

roaring with power. A pair of dim bulbs provide light for the room, barely
barely enough to navigate without getting yourself killed. Various
indicator panels blink happily away, displaying unknown information.

keeping the engine compartment lit up for repair crews.. or marines.

The Engine Compartment is a cramped room, filled with gear shafts and
electrical wiring. A massive disel turbine dominates one whole wall,
roaring with power. A pair of dim bulbs provide light for the room, barely
barely enough to navigate without getting yourself killed. Various
indicator panels blink happily away, displaying unknown information.
~
&w&gThe only disinguishable feature about this compartment is the remains
of the massive disel turbine, still cranking away under all those layers
of alien resin. Nearly all of the lights and panels have been smashed or
covered up, with the exception of the emergancy lights - Now shining away,
keeping the engine compartment lit up for repair crews.. or marines.

&zThird Floor of the Desolation &w:: &WLong Corridor~
The corridors of the Desolation are poorly lit and maintained. Pipes and
electrical conduits line the walls and ceiling, running the length of the
passage. The pipes creak and shudder as the ship shifts in the rough
ocean. Colored lines painted on the floor run up and down the corridor,
indicating the location of important rooms on the ship. 
~
&gThe corridors of the Desolation are covered in a dark resin, secreted by
the Alien hellspawns. The pipes and electrical conduits have been torn
apart, exposing wires and massive holes in the walls. Cubbies and tunnels
branch off from the corridor, creating a myriad of places to hide. The air
is warm and dry, and the  sounds of combat can be heard in the distance.

&zThird Floor of the Desolation &w:: &CMess Hall~
The Mess Hall is in terrible shape. Flipped tables, smashed plates, strewn
silverware. The damage is incredible. Who would have thought a feeling crew
would leave such devastation in their wake. A simple evactuation alert 
would not have done this - The crew must have been chased by something. One
can only imagine what that may have been. 
~
&gThis room is a shadow of its former self. As if the devastation left 
by the fleeing crew wasn't enough, the Aliens have converted this 
place into their personal spawning grounds. An evil-looking resin covers
the walls, giving way to hidden nooks and passages for the little 
hellspawns. The tempature is incredible, and the air is insanely dry.

the cealing keep the air circulating throughout the ship.

The Execution Chamber~
The execution chamber is a dimly lit room with a single armored exit to the
north. Several panels are mounted on the other walls, leading to unknown
chambers. You can't be entirely sure what this room is for, but it
certainly doesn't look pleasent. Unforunetly, there also doesn't appear to
be any obvious or usable exits from the room.
