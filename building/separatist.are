Cavern~
&z The grey walls are smooth and cool to the touch. There rough surface is
interupted only by occassional holes bored into it's surface. Rocks of
varoius sizes and kinds, mostly rocks that have broken off from the rest
of the cavern, pile here and there following the floor of the cavern.
Stalagmites stand firmly grown into the rock. Stalagtites hang down
menacingly from the tall ceiling. very little light filters into the
cavern from a nearby entrance.   A strange metalic camoflaged door like
structure seems to have been placed against the back wall. It appears as
if, if it were moved there would be a large cavern.
~
&w &g The black walls are rough and cool to the touch, slick with slime.
The surface appears uninterupted and random. Piles of greenish black
material stands in various sized columns. The material hangs down
menacingly from the tall ceiling. Large columns of the material stands
here and there throughout the cavern. Almost no light at all filters into
teh cavern from a nearby entrance.

clearing is large enough to allow dropships to land and take off easily
here. The green grass appears healthy. The grass appears to have been
recently smashed down by a large heavy object. The clearing is lit by
multiple flares near it's exterior.

Grassy path~

off into other paths.  The green grass appears green and healthy.  The
grass towards the center of the path appears worn and trampled. The sky is
clearly visible from this vantage point. Large rock outcroppings stand on
either side of the path, occassionally seeming to cut the path off in a
dead end.

sizes and hues. Bugs and worms crawl along the tunnel carrying out varous
tasks. A few stones dot the walls, floor, and ceiling. The dirt tunnel is
barely large enough to stand upright in. Very little light filters in from
the tunnel's entrance. The tunnel occassionaly opens up to a wider area.
wooden bracers line the walls, supporting the ceiling. Lights swing from
the ceiling connected to the support beams.

ground. the dark tunnel is  barely large enough to walk upright. bell like
clumps of material hang from the ceiling at almost regular intervals. The
tunnel occassionaly opens up to a wider area. only a miniscule amount of

Stalagmites stand firmly grown into the rock. Stalagtites hang down

cavern from a nearby entrance. Flood lights light up the room.

Bunker Vantage Point~
&w &c The concrete walls are cool and rough to the touch. The wall's barred
window is nothing more then a long rectangular hole in the bunker's wall.
The bunker's concrete floor is smoother then the wall, but just as
uncomfortable. A dim light allows those in the room to see without
allowing much light to be seen outside of the structure.
~
&w &g The concrete walls are almost covered in a greenish black slimy
substance. The substance almost completely coveres the dim light mounted
in the ceiling, rendering it useless as a light source. The bunker's
concrete floor is also covered in the strange substance, making it uneven.
Spires of the strange substance hang from the ceiling, climb the walls,
and stand on the floor.
