Attention staff, it has come to my attention that someone has been
"borrowing" supplies from the weapons storage room in the back of the
animal testing facility. they are either very smart or very dumb.
Therefore untill further notice it is to be kept locked at all times. The
key code has temporarily been changed to 89950. Destroy this data stick
immediatly.

Body of an eviscerated science officer~
The tourmented look on his face sends shivers down your spine. Being torn
nearly in two by a Xenomorph does not seem like a very peacefull way to
go. Mixed about the pool of blood and guts you notice the tip of a small
plastic object, perhaps you should look under the corpse.

Before Facility Main Gate~
A long dirt road travels north toward an abandoned USCM military base, even
from this distance you can smell the stong aroma of human blood. That
feeling deep inside your gut urges you to turn back before its too late.
The main gate up ahead has been torn down by something, and it opens up to
the remains of Einstein's Colonial Marine Research Base. Damaged military
vehicles and combat armor has been scattered all over here, as well as a
crumbled barracade.

Research Facility Main Gate~
A large reinforced durasteel gate looms in front of you, sturdy enough to
stop even the most determined assault. Bloody claw marks decorate its
surface and bends it into weird shapes. The southwest wall has a long
crack hidden skillfully by xenomorph body parts and human endtrails. A
small window to the east provides a clear view into the guard station.
The corpses of a few dead marines are over here, and it seems like they
died trying to defend the base entrance.

Intersection Inside Main Gate~
Just inside the main gate the ground make a soft squishy sound, perhaps its
better not to look down. The alley streches long into the darkness into
all directions. The lights seem to be broken, because the switch isnt
working. The only way to move around here is if there is a portable light
source or infrared. There are a few corpses here, along with the
exoskeletons of countless xenomorphs. Who knows what horrors lie beyond?

Guard Station~
This guard station would normally have housed a heavily armed marine. The
broken vent in the ceiling and the large pool of cold blood on the floor
tell his tale. To the west a small window offers a fantastic view of the
main gate area, that is if you can  see past the blood stains.

Dark Alley Near Animal Testing~
The musty air reminds you of a crypt, and your not to far off. To the north
east and west into the dark abyss. Before this incident, there were noises
from countless animals of all kinds. Now, there is silence. It wouldn't be
wise to stand around here so keep moving. To the north is a closed door.

Animal Testing Office~
A corpse lies in the corner of this room, it chest torn open from the
inside. Tell tale sign of a chestburster. Research on the xenomorphs would
have been conducted in this facility, no doubt they escaped. The cage room
is to the west, where shards of broken plexiglass and durasteel lie all
over the floor. Paperwork and datapads lie on the floor here, scattered
everywhere.

Cages~
Small white hatches line both of walls from floor to ceiling. A few of them
are open, the rest contain dead facehuggers. One of these things must have
gotten loose and caused all the problems. To the west are stasis chambers
that have been broken; however, the occupants inside were already dead
xenomorph drones. Their shells are all that remain.

A small light bulb sways back and forth at the end of a long black cord
causing the shaddows to jump and flicker about wildly. A few racks have
been set up allong the wall and a large crate occupies most of the floor
space. The air smells stale like a crypt and a small hatch juts from the
ceiling.

Central Junction~
You have reached the main junction within the complex itself. From the
looks of things it would appear that this area has been abandoned for some
time, the broken lights and laque of power only confirm this. Heading
south will take you back to the main gate and a large warehouse is located
to the west. Looming overhead some distance to the north you can make out
a large communicatios array and a landing beacon, perhaps you may find an
operational shuttle.

Leaving the base far in the distance you approach a poorly guarded trail.
The trees are decorated with the innards of your fallen comrads and a
large chainlink fence block your progress northeast. A large hole has been
ripped into the fence but is far out of reach, perhaps the gate has been
left unlocked.

Warehouse Ground Floor~
This area of the floor has been kept clear to provide easy access to the
door which leads upstairs so you will not find any cover in this area. A
large streak of blood disappears under the door and the handle is covered
in a greenish liquid.

Dark Alley~
You have reached a very dark and secluded section of the base. Large metal
crates have been piled high here and a tall chain link fence prevents
further progress east. Amongst a pool of blood you notice a single arm has
been left here, It's fingers appear to be pointing westwards.

Dark Alley~
A large light flashes brilliantly from the north. With the landing becon
operational perhaps there is a way to get out of this god forsaken hell
hole.  The area around you seems quiet enough, the only sound comes from a
series of high voltage power cables located overhead. Their soft buzz is
almost hypnotic.

The power cables over head continue along, the buzzing growing louder as
you aproach a large transformer. Half a human body lies on top of it,
throwing sparks and making quite a smell. Continue north and you will
eventually reach the spaceport, heading south leads back towards the front
gate.

The spaceport looms overhead, blocking everything else from view. Towards

spaceport itself. A small metal ladder hangs off the side of the warehouse
which appears to be used as some sort of fire escape.

Inside Spaceport Main Gate~
Just inside the main gate lies a large open area commonly used for shuttle
landing and takeoffs. Located on the east side of the landing platform is
the control tower and to the west is the Primary Operations Complex.
Although you could most likely remote pilot a shuttle down from the
orbital station from the control tower, the landing becon does not seem to
be operational at the moment.

Landing Platform - North~
Looks like someone already tried using a shuttle to escape. A Xenomorph
must have been hidden inside, it does not look prety. The windows are dyed
a deep color of red and the rear cargo hatch has been completly ripped to
shreds. It seems doubtfull that this thing could lift off, perhaps you
should try locating another means of escape.

Backup Generator Room~
A series of compley looking machinery fills the area and an old looking
backup generator sits idly by in the corner. Perhaps powering up the
generator would provide some power to the base, but you may need to locate
some fuel first.

Long Corridor~
This is the main door of the control tower which leads outside to the
landing platform. The floor grating is plastered with tiny pieces of human
flesh, it looks like someone was grated like cheese. Further down the
corridor is a stairwell leading to the other levels.

End of a Long Corridor~
The overhead lighting gleams off of the floor and brings out the inner
beauty of the blood on the walls, perhaps Predators realy do have an
artistic side to them. A small door here leads to a stairwell which can be
used to access the other levels of the facility.

Stairwell - Ground Floor~
This staircase connect the three levels of the control tower together, Sub
Level A is below and Level 2 is above. Some type of green fluid is smeared
on the railing heading in a downward direction toward the unpowered lower
level, the marines must have injured a predator.

Warehouse Fire Escape~
Jagged metal edges and years of rust tear at your body as you ascend to the
top of the fire escape. The moon light floods in from the east and
illuminates a window to your west. Most often, the alternate route is the

The ground feels a bit sticky, you might not want to know why. A small
metal staircase leads upwards to a catwalk overlooking the entire landing
area, to the east lies a heavily fortified gate.  It is locked and has no
keypad or visible place to use a key, it must be unlocked and opened from
the inside.

Tunnel Checkpoint 1~
The main passage way through the tunnel is large enough to easily
accomodate 2 large APC carriers. Its floor, wall, and ceiling are all made
of a dull grey concrete like material that allows the dank and stagnant
water from above to seep through. The first security checkpoint is located
to the north.

Nothing more than a simple supply closed. Metal shelves line the walls,
stocked with a sorts of cleaning supplies. A single yet very large hole
has been burned into the floor here, by a Xenomorph no doubt. The rest of
the floor looks rather weak and it would probably not be a very smart idea
to tread here.

in the center of the showering area. It is a good thing too, otherwise all
the blood from the hundreds of mangled human carcasses would have just
pooled up. Some of the blood is however seeping into the south wall and
flowing through a very large crack.

Abandoned Sewer Line~
This sewer line is an old relic from long ago, its primitave construction
allows some of the human feces to leak out into the surrounding areas.
Suprisingly enough, after all these years, the waste is still moist and
fresh. The passage continues into the dark depths of the earth.
