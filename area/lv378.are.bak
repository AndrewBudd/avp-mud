A Long Hallway~
The metallic grey floor continues down this corridor. The walls are a
military grey colour, with a dark red strip running parrallel on both
sides of the wall about 1/2 of the way up. The ceiling is a distasteful
black. Randomly located on the grated floor, holes can be seen, with a
sticky substance around them. Somehow it has burnt through the floor? The
hallway brances out to the north.

A Large Office~
A wooden table, 6ft by 4ft dominates the middle of the room.  A metal chair
lies beside it on its side, a piece of it clawed away. Large windows flank
the sides of the room, made of small panels of glass intricatly sowed
together to form a piece of unwanted art.  The walls are painted a
military grey, a dark red line laps the room about one third of the way
up. The cieling being as high up as it is, allows a slight draft to
circulate the room. A large painting dominates the northen wall, most
probably of a historical leader or hero of some sort.

A Long Hallway~
The metallic grey floor continues down this corridor. The walls are a
military grey colour, with a dark red strip running parrallel on both
sides of the wall about 1/2 of the way up. The ceiling is a distasteful
black. Randomly located on the grated floor, holes can be seen, with a
sticky substance around them. Somehow it has burnt through the floor?

A Stairwell~
The military grey theme carries on here. The stairs come down in a spiral,
taking up half the room themselves. The wall behind the stairs looks
misfigured, and out of place. The corridor opens out east west and south,
for quite a way it would seem. The walls seem to have battle scars in
them. Bullet shells, fire marks...scratches?!

The Maintenance Corridor~
The room is as plain and bare as the rest of the compound. Leaking pipes
spray hot steam here and there. The walls show evidence of battles not
long ago, fire marks, bullet holes and even...scratches? The ceiling
appears to support a metallic vent running the width of the room. Some
rubble litters the floor, and the lights flicker from time to time.

The Maintenance Corridor~
The room is as plain and bare as the rest of the compound. Leaking pipes
spray hot steam here and there. The walls show evidence of battles not
long ago, fire marks, bullet holes and even...scratches? The ceiling
appears to support a metallic vent running the width of the room. Some
rubble litters the floor, and the lights flicker from time to time.

An Intersection~
The hall carries on the military grey theme. A blue stripe runs down the
wall horizontally about three quarters of the way up. Lights on either
side of the floor carry on down the, strafing, trying to show which way to
go. Sirens can be heard, the computerised voice cycling over and over. To
the south, a trapezium shaped door with reinforced a ferra-glass window in
the center can be seen. A control switch sits next to it against the wall.

A Large Room~
This room would appear to be a waiting room of some kind. A small desk is
purched against the western wall, with a leather chair behind it.
Documents and folders fill the shelves that are scattered around the room,
at various heights.  The grey motif continues here, but some pictures have
been put up on the wall near the desk.
