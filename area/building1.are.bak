Lobby Entrance~
Walking in through the elaborate glass doors of this building, you look
around and notice a bustling crowd of people making their way around this
large lobby. Many people in suits and ties walk by you as if you did not
exist, seemingly tending to more urgent matters at hand. As you continue
to look around you notice directly ahead of you a security station, as you
look past the security station you notice a row of elevator doors.
~
&g Walking in through the broken glass doors, you hear the echo of the
crunch from the shattered glass beneath your feet. Looking at the walls
surrounding you, you notice what seems to be the remains of bodies beneath
a slimy substance. Ahead of you can be seen the remnance of a security
station, now a breeding ground of ooze and goo. Past the security station
can be seen sparks sputtering from what seems to be the control panel of
the once working elevators.

Security Station~
Coming in from the lobby, you stop directly in front of a Security Station.
Looking behind the large desk you see dozens of small monitors, from which
the Security Officers of the building keep tight surveilance on all the
interactions within the building. As you walk past and continue through
this area you feel the cameras within the building follow your every move.
~
&gComing in from the former lobby, you stop directly in front of what
seemed to be a former security station. Looking behind the half broken
desk you can see the remains of what used to be rows of monitors. The
broken monitors still showing signs of life attempt to flicker and show
brief images through the slimy substance that now covers them.

Waiting Area~
Entering this waiting area, you notice many people here waiting impatiently
for the Elevators to arrive. Pushing your way through the crowd you manage
to stand before a control console for the elevators. Looking directly
above the great metal doors of the elevator you notice numbers that light
up as the elevator moves to a different level.
~
&gEntering this shell of a waiting area, you notice large strands of goo
and slime dripping from the ceiling. Light fixtures dangle from the
ceiling, flickering, providing momentary glimpses of your surroundings.
Directly in front of can be seen a large half mangled door, which leads to
the Elevator shafts of this office building.

Stairwell~
Opening the door and walking through into this dank cold stairwell you
notice graffiti written all over the walls. The stench of urine, the floor
littered with ciggarette butts, and covered with gum is enough to bring a
large sensation of nausea. Holding your breath you continue on to the next
level of this building.
~
&gOpening the door and walking through into this warm wet stairwell you
notice beneath the thick goo on the walls the faint lettering of graffiti.
The floors, slippery from the slime, convinces you to make sure footing of
your steps. Attempting to grab onto the metal banister, you notice it
covered in slimy substance, immediately causing you to grimace at the
sight.

operational. This ladder also leads to different levels of the building.

it very difficult to maneuver in here. Buckets of soapy water spill as you
knock into them, causing you to slip and slide.

of a human. The bones have clearly been slashed through by a sharp object.

Cubicle~
Looking around you can see many partitions separating each section of this
large office area. Directly in front of you lies a chair with a desk. On
the desk you can see many papers in an outbox, and beside the outbox sits
a flat-screen computer flashing with running programs as if it is doing
something of importance.
~
&gLooking around, you can see many broken and slashed partitions, that used
to separate each section of this Slime covered, broken down office area.
Directly in front of you lies a goo covered chair that has been
practically destroyed. Sitting directly in front of the decrepid chair is
a desk leaning on its last two legs. As you continue to look around you
also see sparks coming from the remains of what used to be a computer.

Managerial Office~
Glancing around you automatically notice that this isnt just any office,
but it seems to belong to someone of importance. In front of you sits a
large heavily engraved mohagony desk. Ontop of the desk lies a large
supercomputer, continually reading statistical information and feeding it
to the rest of the network of computers. Behind the desk is a very
comfortable looking seat covered in Korinthian leather. 
~
&gGlancing around the room you automatically notice that this shell of an
office must have belonged to someone of importance, due to the fact that
its larger than most offices on this level. Everything in the office is
slime covered and destroyed, only sparks from the broken computer, and
burning embers seem to give a sense of life to this room.

Entering through the large swinging doors, you see many tables around with
people sitting at them eat their meals and discussing matters of the day.
Beyond all the tables lies a single, of what seems to be, buffet style
counter with different foods being served by the lunch crew. The ambience
of the room is loud and boisterous, you can barely hear yourself think.

Stairwell [Level 3]~
Walking through into this dank cold stairwell you notice graffiti written
all over the walls. The stench of urine, the floor littered with
ciggarette butts, and covered with gum is enough to bring a large
sensation of nausea. Holding your breath you continue on to the next level
of this building. 
~
&gWalking through into this warm wet stairwell you notice beneath the thick
goo on the walls the faint lettering of graffiti. The floors, slippery
from the slime, convinces you to make sure footing of your steps.

substance, immediately causing you to grimace at the sight.

Stairwell [Parking level]~
Walking through into this dank cold stairwell you notice graffiti written
all over the walls. The stench of urine, the floor littered with
ciggarette butts, and covered with gum is enough to bring a large
sensation of nausea. Holding your breath you continue on to the next level
of this building.
~
&gWalking through into this warm wet stairwell you notice beneath the thick
goo on the walls the faint lettering of graffiti. The floors, slippery
from the slime, convinces you to make sure footing of your steps.
Attempting to grab onto the metal banister, you notice it covered in slimy
substance, immediately causing you to grimace at the sight
