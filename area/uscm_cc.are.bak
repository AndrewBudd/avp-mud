m240 flamethrower~
The M240 Flamethrower is a lightweight flame unit used in close quarters.
The fuel for the M240 is pressurized, thickened napthal ignited by a
nozzle burner. Once hit, the target is covered with a layer of burning
fuel, which will continue to burn for approximately 30 seconds. Although
one of the USCM's most feared weapons, it is unpopular with many marines
because of it's low range and the tendency to explode.

USCM Central Compound [Lobby]~
Welcome to the USCM Central Compound, the brave home of the United States
Colonial Marines. This base can house hundreds of marines, and provides
them with a massive selection of weapons for use in the field. Take a look
around, stock up on gear, grab some buddies, and go paste some aliens!
~
&gOnce the proud USCM Central Compound, its been reduced to nothing more
than an alien nesting ground. The walls are covered from floor to ceiling
in a sticky goo-like resin. Once the home of hundreds of marines, it now
houses thousands of ghastly alien horrors, from drones to facehuggers.

~
&gPreviously one of the USCM Central Compounds many security checkpoints,
this chamber is now almost completely unreconizable. The walls are coated
from floor to ceiling with a gooish substance. Its extremely warm in

Inside the USCM Compound Mess Hall~
The USCM Mess hall is a crowed place, a tightly packed room filled with
sweating marines and officers. The odor is almost overpowering at times,
but not nearly as bad as the food they serve. Ironicly enough, the 
tables are spotless, and the floor has a glorious shine to it. These 
people take their work seriously. 
~
&gAt one time, this room resembled the USCM Mess hall. A crowed place,
tightly packed with Marines. Now its been converted into another chunk of
the Alien hive, and goo-filled room with the most ungodly things dripping
from the walls. What a horrible place.
