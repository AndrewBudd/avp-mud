A Marine~
A Hulking Marine stands here, securing the compound.

&wThis &RU&WS&BC&RM&WC&w MP looks like a regular GI, tall and strong. He is
wearing city camo BDUs, shiny black combat boots, a M10 helmet, and M3
body armor. On the right arm of his BDU shirt, there is an MP band to show
that he is military police. He is wielding a M41A pulse rifle like he will
use it, and you can count on it!

USCM Access Corridor B~
The walls are painted a brillant shade of wall, nearly blinding you. Its
just another generic corridor that appear to be the staple of government
buildings and military structures throughout time. A long row of lights on
the ceiling cast a shimmering glow onto the slick tile floors.  
~
&gThe brillant white paintjob of the walls have been burried beneath layers
of a sticky, goo-like substance used by the Aliens. You almost can't tell
its part of a military base. The ceiling lights have been obliterated,
whats left was covered over with that goo-like gunk.

USCM Access Corridor B~
The walls are painted a brillant shade of wall, nearly blinding you. Its
just another generic corridor that appear to be the staple of government
buildings and military structures throughout time. A long row of lights on
the ceiling cast a shimmering glow onto the slick tile floors.  
~
&gThe brillant white paintjob of the walls have been burried beneath layers
of a sticky, goo-like substance used by the Aliens. You almost can't tell
its part of a military base. The ceiling lights have been obliterated,
whats left was covered over with that goo-like gunk.

USCM Office Cubicle~
Just a generic, grey-white office cubicle. It was obviously designed to
provide the upmost entertainment for its occupants. Well, maybe not.
Several pictures hang on the back wall, depicting scenes of places you'd
much rather be, instead of in this drab office cubicle. 
~
&gThis once-drab office cubicle is now alive with a whole array of colors.
And critters. The walls are covered from floor to ceiling in goo, and its
extremely warm in here. This probably isn't a good place to be. Unless of
course, your an alien and happen to like this kind of setting.

USCM Maintaince Access Tunnel~
This dark, dank tunnel is one of the few ways around the USCM Training
complex. Usually, if something breaks, it can be found down here. You can
hear the steady drip-drip-drip of water nearby. You'd think they could
clean this place up a bit. A row of lights hang overhead. 
~
&gAn alien hive is about the only thing creepier than a maintaince tunnel.
And unforunetly, that appears to be the purpose of this room. Floor to
ceiling gunk covers everything, and almost blocks the exits. The air
