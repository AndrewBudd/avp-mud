hunter padding~
This is basic armor given to new warriors trying to attain a position in
the upper castes. The padding is a basic mesh that does not offer much
more protection to the thick hide of the Hunters already. Most are
designed as armored jump suits meant for casual wear in the corridors of
their dark vessels. This is the closest they get to flight suits. This
keeps the Yautja warm even at -50 degrees Celsius.

&W&gVines and trees &Oare slowly intruding onto the small steel pad. 
Echoes of hundreds of animals blow in with the wind.  &rBlood&O stains
stand out on the steel slab, along with the trail leading north.  The life
and atmosphere of the surrounding &W&Ojungle makes it obvious that if not
for this planet's brutal Yautja inhabitants...this would be a beautiful
place.&w

&W&OTwo massive doors block the path ahead, while the side streets seem to
be almost ignored.  Heavily armed guards stand at both sides of the
doorway, prepared to strike intruders.  The &rblood&O trail from the pad
leads through the guarded entrance, looks as though you may never find out
who's &rblood&O it is.

&W&OThe crowds here are HORRIBLE!  Yautji push and fight to get to where
they are going, making a trip to the store a life or death scenario for
many inhabitants.  Life bustles around this Square like nowhere else on
this planet, Perhaps theres a good reason for it.  A tall ladder seems to
lead above to a popular area..

&W&OIt seems rather quiet here despite the music of the jungle below.  A
glass floor makes for a breath-taking view into the jungle world below
you.  Life of all kinds, from beautiful to horrible call the trees home.
If one were to go to the jungle, they would be wise to arm themselves
