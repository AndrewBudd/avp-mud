USCM Central Compound [Lobby]~
Welcome to the USCM Central Compound, the brave home of the United States
Colonial Marines. This base can house hundreds of marines, and provides
them with a massive selection of weapons for use in the field. Take a look
around, stock up on gear, grab some buddies, and go paste some aliens!
~
&gOnce the proud USCM Central Compound, its been reduced to nothing more
than an alien nesting ground. The walls are covered from floor to ceiling
in a sticky goo-like resin. Once the home of hundreds of marines, it now
houses thousands of ghastly alien horrors, from drones to facehuggers.

Inside the USCM Compound Mess Hall~
The USCM Mess hall is a crowed place, a tightly packed room filled with
sweating marines and officers. The odor is almost overpowering at times,
but not nearly as bad as the food they serve. Ironicly enough, the 
tables are spotless, and the floor has a glorious shine to it. These 
people take their work seriously. 
~
&gAt one time, this room resembled the USCM Mess hall. A crowed place,
tightly packed with Marines. Now its been converted into another chunk of
the Alien hive, and goo-filled room with the most ungodly things dripping
from the walls. What a horrible place.

The off-duty lounge gives the Marines somewhere to relax when their not out

for those looking to lounge around. The walls are a tad darker than the
generic brillant white paintjob the USCM staff usually employs. 
~
&gThis appears to have been the off-duty lounge at one time. Its difficult
to tell though. The walls are covered in a goo-like substance, which
almost entirely blots out the off-white walls of the lounge. You can
barely make out the exits from the room. Man, this is disgusting.
