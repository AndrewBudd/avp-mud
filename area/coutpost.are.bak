Communications Outpost :: Operations Center~
This is central operations for the USCM communications outpost. From here,
teams can oversee the operation of the subspace array, and monitor
security, fire and other alert systems. USCM teams spent millions of
dollars making sure this base was as well equipped as possible against any
form of attack. Lets hope it worked. 
~
&gThis room has been taken over by the ever potent Aliens. The walls
arecompletely unreconizible under their thick coating of parastic goo. The
walls are so dark that even if an alien was standing right next to you,you
probably wouldn't even see 'em.

&zThe monitoring station houses row after row of television screens, all
keeping a watchful eye on the more secure sections of the base. The room
is extremely dark, lit only by the blue glow from the monitor screens. A
heavy metal door blocks out noise and other such disturbances, allowing
security personal and technicians to focus on the job at hand.

available, but theres a couple that look somewhat interesting. Anything to
give the Marines the upper hand in combat.

Communications Outpost :: Subspace Radio~
This is the Subspace Array Control Room. Teams of personel spend their
entire day managing it and keeping it in perfect condition. For such a
large room, all the people crowded together sure can make it look small.
In the event an emergancy arises, they will follow their preset guidelines
and call for help and seal the room against attackers.

Enclosed Hallway~
A dark, non-descript USCM hallway. The walls are plain and bare except for
the odd obscurity protruding from it, and the occasional camera. Machinery
noise fills the corridors from piping and mechanical systems used to drive
the subspace array. Dim lights line the ceiling, lighting the hallway but
giving it a creepy feeling at the same time.

A tight fit, these roof access ladders were obviously not made for comfort.
Nothing more than a tall metal ladder with freezing cold rungs, it still
provides quick access to the roof, in case of emergancies or when you need
to access the Landing Beacon. Too bad there isn't an elevator.

Stairwell~
A massive concrete stairwell provides access between levels, in the absence
of a decent elevator. The stairwells provide a tactical advantage over the
elevators, as they require no power to run and are much harder to disable
unless your carrying a serious amount of demolition charges. The walls are
completely bare except for the bulbs lighting the stairs.

Main Hallway~
A dark, non-descript USCM hallway. The walls are plain and bare except for
the odd obscurity protruding from it, and the occasional camera. Machinery
noise fills the corridors from piping and mechanical systems used to drive
the subspace array. Dim lights line the ceiling, lighting the hallway but
giving it a creepy feeling at the same time.

USCM Holding Cell~
Possibly one of the most secure locations in the entire base, this holding
cell still isn't much to look at. The walls are solid concrete and
unmarked except for a single barred window set into it. A massive armored
door with a small window set into it prevents exit from the cell.

Welcome to the USCM Communications Outpost. A massive structure of concrete

communication to the military. Standard, shortrange radio systems can
relay in-system messages to nearby planets, while the massive Subspace
Array provides long range communications outside of the system.

&GIn The Jungle :: Small Clearing~
&gThis hot, humid part of the jungle not only provides shelter for millions
of mosquitoes, but it houses a moderately-sized USCM Communications
Facility, for maintaining contact with other planets and systems. Nearby
is the poorly defended outpost, ready for the taking.

&RUnderground Maintenance Passage~
&rThis passage is little more than a concrete tube lined with wires and
cables. Massive lines run east and west, connecting the Primary Generator
to the Communications Outpost. The tunnel is dark and musty, and extremely
dark. The floor has a small amount of water covering it from the rain.

&RUnderground Power Vault~
&rThis chamber houses the power conductor coils for the Primary Generator.
When the Generator is online, this is absolutely the last place you want
to be. Coming in here is a good way to get yourself nice and toasty.
However, the connecting maintenance passage to the west provides handy
access to the base through a hatchway.

Roof of the Communication Center~
Unholy winds whistle across the platform at tremendous speeds. Its all but
impossible to stay grounded without flying away, although the huge amount
of equipment most marines carry help a bit. This portion of the roof is
really nothing but a gantryway leading to the Landing Beacon.

Electrical Maintenance Locker~
&w&rThe electrical locker houses all sorts of wiring and routing equipment
for the floor. This one has been blown open violently, and the cables
eaten through. Its like something tore its way through it to reach its
destination. The destruction is amazing. 
~
&gThis room has been taken over by the ever potent Aliens. The walls
arecompletely unreconizible under their thick coating of parastic goo. The
walls are so dark that even if an alien was standing right next to you,you
probably wouldn't even see 'em.
