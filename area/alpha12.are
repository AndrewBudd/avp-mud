A Marine~
An insane Marine, is standing here talking to himself.
~
&wThis &RU&WS&BC&RM&WC&w MP looks like a regular GI, tall and strong. He is
wearing city camo BDUs, shiny black combat boots, a M10 helmet, and M3
body armor. On the right arm of his BDU shirt, there is an MP band to show
that he is military police. He is wielding a M41A pulse rifle like he will
use it, and you can count on it!

correctional facility. Screams and cries for help can be heard echoing
throughout the hallways.
